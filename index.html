        <h2 class="title">Egypt</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Egypt, officially known as the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a country located at the crossroads of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its history, ancient civilization, and iconic landmarks. With a population of over 100 million people, Egypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and the third most populous in Africa. The capital city, Cairo, is a vibrant metropolis situated on the banks of the Nile River. Egypt is renowned for its ancient wonders, including the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, and the temples of Luxor & Karnak.</p>

      <h2>Pyramids of Giza</h2>
      <p>The Pyramids of Giza are one of Egypt's most iconic and well-known landmarks. Located on the outskirts of Cairo, these ancient structures have captivated people's imagination for centuries. Here's some information about the Pyramids of Giza:</p><br>
      <p>Construction: The Pyramids of Giza were built as tombs for the pharaohs during the Old Kingdom period of ancient Egypt. The most famous and largest pyramid is the Great Pyramid, also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops. It was constructed around 4,500 years ago, during the 26th century BCE. The other two main pyramids at the site are the Pyramid of Khafre (Chephren) and the Pyramid of Menkaure (Mycerinus).

        Structure: The Great Pyramid of Khufu is the largest of the three, standing approximately 481 feet (147 meters) tall. It was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years until the completion of the Lincoln Cathedral in England. The pyramids were built using limestone blocks, which were carefully cut and transported to the site. These massive structures are remarkable feats of engineering and precision.
        
        Sphinx: Adjacent to the Pyramids of Giza is the Great Sphinx, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human. It is believed to represent the pharaoh Khafre. The Sphinx stands approximately 66 feet (20 meters) tall and is carved out of a single block of limestone.</p><br>
      <p>Purpose: The pyramids were built as elaborate burial sites for the pharaohs, serving as monuments to their power and authority. It was believed that the pharaohs would continue their journey in the afterlife, and the pyramids were designed to protect their bodies and belongings for eternity.

        Archaeological Significance: The Pyramids of Giza are not only impressive structures but also hold significant historical and archaeological importance. They have provided valuable insights into ancient Egyptian civilization, including their engineering techniques, religious beliefs, and social hierarchy.
        
        Tourism: The Pyramids of Giza are major tourist attractions, drawing visitors from all over the world. Tourists have the opportunity to explore the interiors of some pyramids, witness the intricate burial chambers, and marvel at the scale and precision of these ancient structures. Camel rides and sound and light shows are also popular activities at the site.</p><br>

        <p>Historically the Great Pyramid had been attributed to Khufu based on the words of authors of classical antiquity, first and foremost Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus. However, during the Middle Ages other people were credited with the construction of the pyramid as well, for example Joseph from the Book of Genesis, Nimrod, or the legendary king Saurid ibn Salhouk.

            In 1837 four additional Relieving Chambers were found above the King's Chamber after tunneling to them. The chambers, previously inaccessible, were covered in hieroglyphs of red paint. The workers who were building the pyramid had marked the blocks with the names of their gangs, which included the pharaoh's name (e.g.: "The gang, The white crown of Khnum-Khufu is powerful"). The names of Khufu were spelled out on the walls over a dozen times. Another of these graffiti was found by Goyon on an exterior block of the 4th layer of the pyramid. The inscriptions are comparable to those found at other sites of Khufu, such as the alabaster quarry at Hatnub or the harbor at Wadi al-Jarf, and are present in pyramids of other pharaohs as well.
            
            Throughout the 20th century the cemeteries next to the pyramid were excavated. Family members and high officials of Khufu were buried in the East Field south of the causeway, and the West Field. Most notably the wives, children and grandchildren of Khufu, Hemiunu, Ankhaf and (the funerary cache of) Hetepheres I, mother of Khufu. As Hassan puts it: "From the early dynastic times, it was always the custom for the relatives, friends and courtiers to be buried in the vicinity of the king they had served during life. This was quite in accordance with the Egyptian idea of the Hereafter."
            
            The cemeteries were actively expanded until the 6th dynasty and used less frequently afterwards. The earliest pharaonic name of seal impressions is that of Khufu, the latest of Pepi II. Worker graffiti was written on some of the stones of the tombs as well; for instance, "Mddw" (Horus name of Khufu) on the mastaba of Chufunacht, probably a grandson of Khufu.
            
            Some inscriptions in the chapels of the mastabas (like the pyramid, their burial chambers were usually bare of inscriptions) mention Khufu or his pyramid. For instance, an inscription of Mersyankh III states that "Her mother [is the] daughter of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Khufu." Most often these references are part of a title, for example, Snnw-ka, "Chief of the Settlement and Overseer of the Pyramid City of Akhet-Khufu" or Merib, "Priest of Khufu". Several tomb owners have a king's name as part of their own name (e.g. Chufudjedef, Chufuseneb, Merichufu). The earliest pharaoh alluded to in that manner at Giza is Snefru (Khufu's father).
            
            In 1936 Hassan uncovered a stela of Amenhotep II near the Great Sphinx of Giza, which implies the two larger pyramids were still attributed to Khufu and Khafre in the New Kingdom. It reads: "He yoked the horses in Memphis, when he was still young, and stopped at the Sanctuary of Hor-em-akhet (the Sphinx). He spent a time there in going round it, looking at the beauty of the Sanctuary of Khufu and Khafra the revered."
            
            In 1954 two boat pits, one containing the Khufu ship, were discovered buried at the south foot of the pyramid. The cartouche of Djedefre was found on many of the blocks that covered the boat pits. As the successor and eldest son he would have presumably been responsible for the burial of Khufu. The second boat pit was examined in 1987; excavation work started in 2010. Graffiti on the stones included 4 instances of the name "Khufu", 11 instances of "Djedefre", a year (in reign, season, month and day), measurements of the stone, various signs and marks, and a reference line used in construction, all done in red or black ink.
            
            During excavations in 2013 the Diary of Merer was found at Wadi al-Jarf. It documents the transportation of white limestone blocks from Tura to the Great Pyramid, which is mentioned by its original name Akhet Khufu (with a pyramid determinative) dozens of times. It details that the stones were accepted at She Akhet-Khufu ("the pool of the pyramid Horizon of Khufu") and Ro-She Khufu ("the entrance to the pool of Khufu"), which were under supervision of Ankhhaf, half brother and vizier of Khufu, as well as owner of the largest mastaba of the Giza East Field.</p><br>
